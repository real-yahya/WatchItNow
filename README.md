WatchItNow App (Alpha)

Overview

WatchItNow is an innovative mobile application designed to tackle the common problem of not knowing what to watch. In the vast sea of entertainment options available today, users often find themselves spending more time searching for something to watch than actually enjoying content. WatchItNow aims to simplify this process by providing users with personalized recommendations based on their preferences and previous viewing history.

Features

Personalized Recommendations: WatchItNow utilizes advanced algorithms, powered by machine learning, to analyze a user's viewing habits and preferences. This enables the app to suggest movies, TV shows, and web series that are likely to resonate with the user's taste.
Extensive Database: The app is integrated with an SQLite database that stores an extensive collection of movies and TV shows, along with relevant metadata. This database allows for quick and efficient retrieval of information, ensuring a seamless user experience.
User Profiles: Users can create individual profiles within the app, allowing multiple users on the same device to receive tailored recommendations based on their unique viewing behavior.
Search Functionality: WatchItNow offers a powerful search feature, enabling users to explore the database based on specific genres, actors, directors, or keywords. This ensures that users can easily discover content of interest.
Technologies Used

WatchItNow is currently in alpha development and is built using the Kivy framework, a popular Python library for creating cross-platform mobile applications with a natural user interface. Kivy's versatility and ease of use allowed for rapid development, even though the project remains unfinished.

The integration of the SQLite database was chosen for its lightweight and self-contained nature. SQLite's compatibility with Kivy facilitated smooth data management and storage within the app.

Installation

As the app is still in alpha development, installation instructions will be provided once the development reaches a stable point. At that time, users will be able to download the app from the official app stores for iOS and Android or sideload it onto their devices.

Future Development

WatchItNow is an ongoing project in alpha development, and the team is actively working on implementing exciting new features. Some of the upcoming enhancements include:

User authentication and account creation to sync preferences across multiple devices.
Integration with popular streaming platforms to allow direct streaming of recommended content.
Enhanced recommendation algorithms through collaborative filtering and sentiment analysis.
Support for user-generated playlists and sharing recommendations with friends.
Feedback and Contributions

We encourage users and developers alike to provide feedback on the app's functionality and report any issues or bugs. If you are interested in contributing to the project, feel free to reach out to the development team or check out the GitHub repository here to get involved.
